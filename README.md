# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project is a template that provides a minimal setup to get React working with TypeScript and Vite. It includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules to ensure code quality.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

## Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
